About Dataset:

This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were cancelled.


Business Challenge:

•	A high cancellation rate results in a loss of revenue, especially when operating the hotel at the same cost.

Research Questions:

•	What are the variables that are responsible for hotel cancellation.
•	How to counter hotel reservation cancellation.
•	How to help hotels to make pricing and promotional decisions.

Research Hypothesis:

•	More cancellation occurs when customers find cheaper options at neighbouring hotels.
•	Most customers book from an offline agent.

Assumptions:

•	Hotel information data is current and can be used to analyse hotel reservations.
•	Hotel will accept the advice without any concern.
•	Currently, hotels are not already following any of the suggestions we propose.
•	Biggest factor affecting the earning is cancellation.
•	Hotels have no earning for the day from the room on the day of cancellation.

Suggestions based upon Conclusions reached through EDA:

1.	Cancellation is mostly due to high prices and Hotel cannot do without the higher pricing. Hence, to prevent cancellations without lowering prices, hotel may adopt the following strategies and schemes:

    A.	Keep the customer engaged, and excited about the stay in their hotels, by providing live dashboard/countdown or other animation/gamification related to their stay – it would keep the customer wanting to get there.

    B.	Offer small yet free incentives to the customer on a daily basis (if booked few days before) or weekly/monthly basis (if booked weeks before/month before) like coupon for a free snack, one time pool usage for the members, complementary drink. It would keep the customer interested in the hotel services.

    C.	Regularly provide itinerary plans, tourist spots, food joints recommendation to enrich the customers hotel stay.

2.	As January sees the most cancellation which is accompanied by highest ADRs, hotel should consider providing extra discounts for the customers who are booking early for those months, to prevent them from cancelling their bookings due to competitive pricing of neighbouring hotels. Hotels can run special marketing campaigns for these months to lower cancellations and ensure net profit.

3.	Portugal witnesses the highest number of cancelations in their hotels. Hotels in the region should focus on improving the quantity and experience of the hotel stay.

4.	Online booking sees the second highest number of cancellations – Hotels should produce more promotional videos, aesthetical photos, and customer testimony videos, and regularly offer coupons to prevent customers from cancelling due to competitive pricing of other hotels.
